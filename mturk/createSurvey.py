			<p>We gathered content from a set of webpages for the purpose of gathering samples of online news articles. You will be shown excerpts of these webpages.
            Your task is to select the label that <b>best</b> describes the original content of each excerpt. That is, you will:</p>
            <p><ol>
                <li>Determine whether the content shown is a valid excerpt from a news article, and</li>
